Purpose: Define Gold-layer dimensional and fact views for analytics and reporting.

Summary:
 - Creates star schema views in the `gold` schema for analytics consumption.
 - Combines data from silver-layer curated tables with transformations
   and dimension key generation for analytics and BI tools.
 - Includes dimension tables (customers, products) and fact tables (sales).

Views defined:
 - gold.dim_customers
   Dimension view with customer master data, demographics, and location.
   Key columns: customer_key (surrogate), customer_id, first_name, last_name,
                country, gender, birthdate, marital_status, create_date.
   Sources: silver.crm_cust_info, silver.erp_cust_az12, silver.erp_loc_a101

 - gold.dim_products
   Dimension view with product master data and category taxonomy.
   Key columns: product_key (surrogate), product_id, product_number, product_name,
                category_id, category, subcategory, maintenance, cost, 
                product_line, start_date.
   Sources: silver.crm_prd_info, silver.erp_px_cat_g1v2
   Filter: Excludes historical/ended products (prd_end_dt is null).

 - gold.fact_sales
   Fact view of transactional sales orders with references to dimensions.
   Key columns: order_number, product_key, customer_key, order_date,
                shipping_date, due_date, sales_amount, quantity, price.
   Sources: silver.crm_sales_details, gold.dim_products, gold.dim_customers

Notes / Usage:
 - These views consume silver-layer (curated) tables. Ensure silver schema
   and tables are populated before querying gold views.
 - Surrogate keys are generated dynamically via ROW_NUMBER(); they may change
   if source data order or filters change. Use business keys for joins.
 - Performance: Consider materializing these views if query latency becomes
   an issue for downstream BI/analytics tools.
 - The fact_sales view performs joins to dimension tables; validate referential
   integrity and ensure product/customer dimensions are complete.
